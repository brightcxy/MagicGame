Traditional games use mouse, keyboard, and controllers as interaction mediums. People still developing new interaction methods such as VR controller, laser gun, steering wheel to improve the gameplay experience. However, these mediums can only be played by hands. Rethinking the interaction methods, we can not only use our hands but also use our voice to control the game. 

Today almost every player have their microphone to voice chat online, we could take their microphone as voice input. With the help of AI, computers are doing well on recognize our voice. So that we can say something on play then the game could give us feedback, which improves the gameplay experience.

You are not a wizard, but you can be a wizard in a game. Saying a spell name, you could use the spell in the game.
